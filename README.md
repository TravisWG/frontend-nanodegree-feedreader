This project can be run by opening index.html in a web browser.  The Jasmine test suites will appear at the bottom of the page.  The selected feed can be changed by accessing the menu via the menu icon in the upper left corner.

This webpage loads several feeds using Google's Feed Reader API.

The Jasmine spec sheet is located at jasmine/spec/feedreader.js.  Within this file, tests are being run to ensure that the RSS feeds are defined, have names, and have URLs.  Menu css functionality is tested as well as the functionality of the intially loaded feed and secondarily loaded RSS feeds.
